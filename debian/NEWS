curl (7.28.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  From this version the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST option will stop accepting "1"
  as a valid value. From the documentation:

  > When the value is 1, libcurl will return a failure. It was previously (in
  > 7.28.0 and earlier) a debug option of some sorts, but it is no longer
  > supported due to frequently leading to programmer mistakes.
